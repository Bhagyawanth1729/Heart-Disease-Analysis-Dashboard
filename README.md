🧬 Dataset Overview
The dataset contains the following columns:

Column	Description
age	Age of the patient
anaemia	Anaemia status (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
creatinine_phosphokinase	Enzyme level (mcg/L)
diabetes	Diabetes status (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
ejection_fraction	Percentage of blood ejected from the heart
high_blood_pressure	High blood pressure status (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
platelets	Platelet count (kiloplatelets/mL)
serum_sodium	Blood sodium level (mEq/L)
sex	Gender (1 = Male, 0 = Female)
smoking	Smoking status (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
survival_rate	Estimated survival rate
death_event	1 = Died, 0 = Survived
time	Follow-up duration (days)
